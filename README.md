# android-sms

This app was created by [Christoph Studer](chstuder@gmail.com) and hosted at [Google Code](https://code.google.com/p/android-sms/).  With Google Code's imminent shutdown, I decided to create a safety copy at GitHub.

Note that this is not a complete archive!  The automatic *Google Code to GitHub* process was unable to transfer this project over for reasons unknown ("GitHub code import failure: Error! There was an error pushing commits to GitHub.") so this transfer was made via manual SVN checkout and Git import.

Minor changes to the build files were made to allow Eclipse to recognise the project.  No changes to source have been made at this time.

The following data was maintained:

- Snapshot of the trunk, representing v1.1.1

The following data was lost:

- All code on the v1.0.0 branch
- Any information about the v1.1.0 tag
- Commit history, including commit messages
- The Wiki (a single page user guide)
- The issues list (164 items at time of writing)

If any of these can be recovered, if appropriate these will be placed into the "meta" directory.
